## What is the SHSAT?

The SHSAT is an entrance exam for eight of NYC's nine specialized high schools. They are all prestigious nationally recognized public schools. Their curriculums are more rigorous than most public and private high schools in New York.

## Available seats

The SHSAT is available to all NYC 8th and 9th graders. 9th graders take a harder test and have fewer seats available to them. There are approximately 5000 seats available each year. Every year approximately 28,000 students take the SHSAT. Just under 20% of those applicants are admitted into a specialized high school.

## When is the test?

The dates for the 2022 test haven't been announced yet, but the most recent test was in early December 2021. The test used to be regularly held in mid-October, so for now we can expect it to be held sometime in the Winter or as early as mid October.

## When should you start studying for the SHSAT?

Within 6 to 12 months before their test, but not earlier. One year of prep seems to be perfect for the SHSAT. Most timed-standardized-highschool-admissions-tests test students on similar skills. The skills developed for one test will carry over to your child's prep for their next test. If your child recently prepped for a similar test, then they won't need to study as much as they would otherwise. So, it depends. You can always start early and slow down the prep as your child achieves their desired score. The earlier they begin, the more practice tests they can take. Taking more practice tests results in higher scores, higher confidence, higher consistency, and a higher likelihood of success for these types of tests.
