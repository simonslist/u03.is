- The 9th-grade SHSAT

Sometimes admitted 9th graders don’t like their specialized schools and opt for another school. There is a 9th-grade exam in order to fill the vacant seats. Of which, there are few as very few leave the schools once they get in.

The 9th-grade exam has the same format, but higher level topics and questions. There are fewer practice tests released by the DOE and third-party publishers, which means there are significantly fewer resources for practice. The test is harder, and prepping for it is harder as well.

In the past, I have recommended some people not to take the 9th-grade test at all. Even if a person passes the 9th-grade test, they will be at a disadvantage when they join a specialized school. These schools move fast, and it’s challenging to match their pace after missing their freshman years.

Nevertheless, you can always decide after you get the results back.

Part A will test you on grammar rules for punctuation, clauses, subject-verb agreement, and more. Use this post as a curated list of helpful learning resources.

SHSAT grammar topics:

The following topics can be combined, split, and organized in many different ways. Every grammar book and SHSAT workbook has their own take on how and when to learn each topic. This is my take- I’ve listed each topic in the same order that I typically use for my own 1-on-1 students. If you don’t have much time to study, you should review only the topics that are causing you trouble.

SHSAT Structure topics:

The second part of the Revising/Editing section is the newest and most vague section of the SHSAT. Every SHSAT workbook and publisher has their own take on what kind of topics will appear on the exam. This post is based on the DOE description. If you don’t have much time to study, you should review only the topics that are causing you trouble.

Resources:

There are tons of resources on the internet, but these are some that I thought were especially useful and clarifying. There are multiple resources listed under most topics. You don’t have to check out all of them. Use them for additional examples, and as alternative explanations. Most of the resources are written for people trying to write better- not for test takers. Nevertheless, the resources will help you identify better writing and therefore help you answer questions about improving writing.
