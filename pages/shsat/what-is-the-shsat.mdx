SHSAT stands for Specialized High School Admissions Test.

The SHSAT is an entrance exam for eight specialized high schools in NYC.

The SHSAT is administered by the NYC DOE and is only available to NYC students in the 8th and 9th grades. Most students take it in the 8th grade. The 9th grade version is harder and the number of seats available at the schools is fewer.

## What is the SHSAT?

The SHSAT is an entrance exam for eight of NYC's nine specialized high schools. They are all prestigious nationally recognized public schools. Their curriculums are more rigorous than most public and private high schools in New York.

## The schools that require the SHSAT for admissions:

- Stuyvesant High School, Manhhattan
- Bronx High School of Science
- Brooklyn Technical High School
- Brooklyn Latin School
- High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College, Manhhattan
- High School for American Studies at Lehman College, Bronx
- Queens High School for Sciences at York College
- Staten Island Technical High School

## Available seats

There are approximately 5000 seats available each year. In 2017, 28,000 students took the SHSAT. Less than 20% of those applicants were accepted into a specialized high school.

## What Does the SHSAT Cover?

There are two main sections on the SHSAT - English language arts (ELA) and math.

ELA: 57 multiple-choice questions on reading passages and grammar

Math: 57 questions, 52 multiple-choice questions and five grid-in questions

## How is the SHSAT scored?

There are 114 questions split between both sections and 10 randomly placed field questions in each section that do not count. A total of 94 raw points can be earned from the two sections of the SHSAT exam. For every correct answer a student receives a point. This is called the raw score.

Raw scores are used to determine the scaled score a student earns for each section of the test. The conversion process adjusts for the differing levels of difficulty that may occur between test versions. Once the scaled scores are determined, they are added together to produce the student's composite score, which is typically no higher than 700.

## How Does the Acceptance Process Work?

The student who earns the highest score on the SHSAT is offered admission to his or her first-choice school if there is space available. Once the student with the highest score is placed, admission is offered to the student with the second-highest score, and so on. Individuals who receive an offer of acceptance are accepted to the school that was their top choice unless that school is full. They are then offered their second-choice school. The acceptance process works down the list, so if the top two schools a student picked are full then they are offered admission to their third-choice school. The students with the highest scores are most likely to receive acceptance to their top school choices.

## How is admission determined?

When students take the SHSAT, they list their choices for which specialized school they would like in order of preference. Then, each student who took the test is ranked on a scale from highest score to lowest score.

The students who scored the highest get placed into their top-choice school. If a student's first choice is selected by the time their score comes up in the placement process, they are placed in their second-choice school. If their second choice is selected, they get placed in their third-choice school.

In November 2005, a New York Times article found that students scoring in the 90th percentile on both sections would not gain admittance to their first choice schools; meanwhile, those scoring in the 99th percentile on one section and the 50th percentile on the other, would.[18] This happens because the final grade and percentile represent the total score and the curve within sections.

## Available seats

The SHSAT is available to all NYC 8th and 9th graders. 9th graders take a harder test and have fewer seats available to them. There are approximately 5000 seats available each year. Every year approximately 28,000 students take the SHSAT. Just under 20% of those applicants are admitted into a specialized high school.

## When is the SHSAT?

The test is normally offered in mid-October for 8th graders and mid-November for 9th graders. In 2021 and 2022, however, the test was offered in January due to COVID.

## When is the test?

The dates for the 2022 test haven't been announced yet, but the most recent test was in early December 2021. The test used to be regularly held in mid-October, so for now we can expect it to be held sometime in the Winter or as early as mid October.

## How to register for the test

In order to take the test, students must first register and obtain a ticket from their guidance counselor. The ticket will state the specific date, time, and location of the SHSAT. The ticket will also need to be signed by their parent or legal guardian.

## Can Students Receive Testing Accommodations for the SHSAT?

Students who are already approved for IEPs or 504 plans typically qualify to receive test accommodations such as extra testing time and/or quieter rooms.
