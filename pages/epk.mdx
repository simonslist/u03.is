## Biography

Simon went to his first raves during the pandemic in March 2021. 3 months later, he traveled to CDMX and became inspired by the eclectic dark experimental scene. Within weeks, he started a a local flyer-sharing community (S List CDMX), mapped out most of the dark rave scene, and became involved as an anonymous curator for both locals and fellow tourists alike.

Within a year, Simon re-introduced himself as a DJ. His alias is a shout-out to the community that has been giving him a platform, a voice, and the opportunity to explore every corner of the rave scene without restriction.

His sets remind us that we all experience feelings of misery and anger- regardless of our backgrounds. And as someone who ironically hates the spotlight, the positive feedback from his audiences often drives him to scare them away - something that seems to pull them in even closer.

sli.st was first introduced to the rave scene in March 2021. 3 months later he went to CDMX in search of more techno. After a few weeks of raving, sli.st started an online flyer sharing community to help map out the local rave scene. 2 months later he started learning from one of the best industrial DJs of the CDMX underground.

Thanks to his online community, sli.st has become a trusted curator of the CDMX dark techno scene. When sli.st gets excited about a party, he agressively helps spread the word.
