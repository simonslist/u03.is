## Biography

Simon went to his first raves during the NYC lockdowns in March 2021. 3 months later he traveled to CDMX, became inspired by the darker experimental scene, and developed a community around curating music events. While mapping out the rave scene as an anonymous curator (and shitposter), Simon leveraged his audience and re-introduced himself as a DJ with an already established base.

His sets remind us that we all experience feelings of misery and anger- regardless of our backgrounds. And as someone who ironically hates the spotlight, the positive feedback from his audiences often drives him to scare them away - something that seems to pull them in even closer.
